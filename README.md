First, open the project and follow path "\src\main\resources\application.properties" to configuation application.properties to connect database.

Make sure you created database "student" and change username and password with your MySQL account, then go to pom.xml file -> Maven -> Reload project.

Second, go to DemoApplication and Run. After the program has finished running. Open your browser "http://localhost:8080/api/spring-boot/student"  to see API of backend

Finally, open terminal at "\src\angular-frontend", then run command "npm install" to install node_modules folder. Once done, run command "ng serve" then open "http://localhost:4200" in your browser to see the frontend.

Run the backend first, then run the frontend later. Good luck
